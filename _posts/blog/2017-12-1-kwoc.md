I and other members of my team at `Alchem Synergy` are mentors for project `Alchem` this year under KWOC.

### About KWOC
KWOC or Kharagpur Winter of Code is a 5-week long online programme for the students, who are new to open source software development. The programme not only helps students to get involved in open source, but also preps them for many open source summer programmes, Google Summer of Code being one of them. Visit [here](http://kwoc.kossiitkgp.in) to know more

### Why to mentor in KWOC?
There are various benefits to mentor in any open source project:
 * Management Skills
 * Keeping the open source project alive without much effort on your own
 * Change to be a speaker at Open Source summit in IIT Kharagpur

My organisation `Alchem Synergy` aims to grow even more so I though it would be good idea to participate as a mentor in KWOC to grow as a community and enhance `Alchem` even more.
