## Something to see
The people are really friendly (both professionally and interpersonally). You can feel the warmth as soon as you enter the company, HR team welcomed us cordially and in no time we all were sharing laughs. They arranged a Pizza treat, which was more like a party because of the all the food that we couldn't eat. We met new people and introduced ourselves to them too. This is something which becomes natural when you like to make your presence count, doesn't it?

## Something to feel
The way everything is organised in the company from applying for a leave to logging work hours, keeps the redundancy at bay and effort for such tasks at minimum. That what excites the employee, company doesn't only provides solutions to others' problems. They concentrate on optimising their existing methods too, for better efficiency.<br>
I got my work laptop on the first day itself, that escalated a sense of responsibility in a really good way.

## Something to hear
At the end of the day, we had a chance to interact with company's president Mr. Saurajit Kanungo via Skype call. He currently handles both the Cyber Group centres (one in Dallas and the other in Noida) from Dallas only. We (me and other freshers) were fortunate enough to have a talk with Mr. Saurajit since he agreed to have an interaction with us so early in the morning (according to Dallas time).

## Something to expect
This goes both ways, our expectation from the company and company's expectation from us. It's highly unlikely that our expectations won't be met and I'm trying my best to meet their expectations.

## Something to learn
Company is organising a `bootcamp` to give us a brief overview of what technlogies does company generally uses and which all technlogies are being used to develop ongoing projects. <br>

The start was good. Looking forward for an even more thrilling journey ahead!
